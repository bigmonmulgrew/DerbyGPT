The primary goal of the AI-driven Discord bot project was to explore the capabilities of AI in creating a bot that could write and partly program itself, thereby boosting productivity and problem-solving efficiency. The project had threefold objectives: First, to test the bot's ability to autonomously enhance its functionality and productivity. Second, to enable the bot to mimic human-like behavior within Discord, particularly in responding naturally in different contexts. In general chat, it was designed to behave casually like a student, incorporating elements like emojis and informal language. Conversely, in an academic help channel (SOS), it was intended to respond like an experienced student mentor or lecturer, offering guidance more than direct answers. The botâ€™s development journey was unique as it involved only the programmer and ChatGPT, with the programmer having only four weeks of experience in Python at the onset. This setup presented both a challenge and an opportunity to assess how effectively AI can assist in a complex programming task with limited initial expertise.
