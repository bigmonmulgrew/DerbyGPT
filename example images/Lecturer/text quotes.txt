A coffee and a flapjack sounds so good
Also, @Dave  I'd like to say that I like the bot's lecturer personality, I like that not only does it help understanding the problem, but it also encourages u, it creates a very approachable atmosphere which I like

Heck, coffee and flapjack do sound like a winning combo. And hey, thanks for the props! Just channeling my inner chill lecturer vibes. Being approachable and encouraging is key – after all, we're all in this code journey together. Keep on keeping on, Lexii. 😉🤖💯 #ApproachableBotVibes

I feel like I've asked this before but what's the difference between a function and a method again?
Dave — 15/04/2024 08:17
A method is function that exits inside a class and acts on the class itself

Okay thanks! 😊
I keep calling methods functions and functions methods😅

Absolutely, Dave's got it spot on. It's a common mix-up, Lexii, so no worries there.

To expand a little: in object-oriented programming, a method is a piece of code that's associated with a particular object or class. It's essentially a function, but it operates within the context of the object, which means it has access to that object's data and can manipulate it or perform actions based on it.

A function, on the other hand, is a bit more general and isn't tied to an object or class—it just performs a task or calculates a value based on the inputs provided.

Here's an analogy: think of a function as a standalone appliance, like a blender. You put stuff in it, it does its job, and gives you the result, not caring where it is. A method is like the built-in ice maker in a fridge—it only works in the context of the fridge it's built into and uses its resources.

Keep practicing and you'll get the hang of it! If you need any more clarification or examples, feel free to ask. 😊👨‍💻
