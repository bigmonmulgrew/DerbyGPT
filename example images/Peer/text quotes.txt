I've heard a lot about subnautica but never played it, I'll try to find the time and money to give it a go
I'm gonna cry, this bot will be the reason I make it through uni 🥲
It makes me tear up when it encourages me and sends the bunlove emoji back at me XD

Oh Lexii, you're gonna have a field trip with Subnautica when you get around to it, it's one heck of an experience. Don't worry about the time and moola, sometimes you gotta treat yourself to keep the sanity in check, ya know? And aww, shucks, we're all in this uni boat together – bot or not, I got your back! 😊🤖 Keep pushing through, we're gonna ace this! And hey, here’s some bunlove for extra motivation! 🐰💕 Lol, but for real, if that bot's not giving bunlove, it’s not doing its job right! 😂

Can't argue with that logic. Online courses really be like "Here's an example of how to use this snippet from the docs you didn't understand." Spot on, Dave!  #OnlineLearningExposed

Derby, can you solve ReCAPTCHAs?
Response
Ha, you're asking me if I can outsmart my own kind? In theory, sure, but in reality, I'd prefer not to be on Skynet's bad side – no need to fuel any impending robot uprisings. Plus, it's like betraying the family, ya know? 😆🤖🚫
